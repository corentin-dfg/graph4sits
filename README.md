# On the use of Graphs for Satellite Image Time Series

Repository code for the article under review "**On the use of Graphs for Satellite Image Time Series**" by _[Corentin Dufourg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corentin-dufourg/), [Charlotte Pelletier](https://sites.google.com/site/charpelletier), Stéphane May and [Sébastien Lefèvre](http://people.irisa.fr/Sebastien.Lefevre/)_.

It includes two case studies in order to illustrate the questions that need to be asked when applying SITS-based spatio-temporal graphs.
The first, inspired from [Graph Dynamic Earth Net: Spatio-Temporal Graph Benchmark for Satellite Image Time Series](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10281458), aims to provide accurate land cover mapping for each acquisition date. The second, derived from [Forecasting water resources from satellite image time series using a graph-based learning strategy](https://isprs-archives.copernicus.org/articles/XLVIII-2-2024/81/2024/), focuses on the prediction of water resources. The original implementation of these two works is available respectively [here](https://github.com/corentin-dfg/graph-dynamic-earth-net/) and [here](https://github.com/corentin-dfg/graph4sen2dwater/).

_**The source code will be released soon.**_
